Welcome to this repository.

This project doubles as a research-related fulfilment for 
CS 398: Undergraduate Research at UIC and also as the brainchild
of Pat Troy, the professor under which this project was assigned
and completed.

other info
Concerning data files: a course listing of "99" under a 
certain instructor indicates NONE for that class spot. 
If an instructor only teaches 3 classes, those classes
should be assigned to the class1, class2, and class3 spots, 
leaving "99" as a placeholder for the other 5 spots.
