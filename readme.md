Welcome to this repository.

This project doubles as a research-related fulfilment for 
CS 398: Undergraduate Research at UIC and also as the brainchild
of Pat Troy, the professor under which this project was assigned
and completed.

Professor Troy is in charge of choosing which CS professors teach each 
class every semester for the following semester. As such, he suggested
this project as a potentially viable solution to this manual task
by choosing professors using a GUI application. 

The above application does just that. Also included is a GUI editor 
for updating which classes each CS instructor teaches. Despite a 
relatively simple GUI, this project features an attention to detail 
and professional object oriented design throughout code. 

To run: Download final.zip above and extract the files 
(the JAR file and the data folder need to be in the same directory).
You'll also need Java Runtime to execute the JAR file.
